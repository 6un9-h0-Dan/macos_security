title: "Disable Removable Storage Devices"
discussion: |
  Removable media, such as USB connected external hard drives, thumb drives, and optical media, _MUST_ be disabled for users.
  
  Disabling removable storage devices reduces the risks and known vulnerabilities of such devices (e.g., malicious code insertion)
  
  [IMPORTANT]
  ====
  Some organizations rely on the use of removable media for storing and sharing data. Information System Security Officers (ISSOs) may make the risk-based decision not to disable external hard drives to avoid losing this functionality, but they are advised to first fully weigh the potential risks posed to their organization.
