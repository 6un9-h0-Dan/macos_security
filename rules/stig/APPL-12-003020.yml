title: The macOS system must use multifactor authentication for local access to privileged
  and non-privileged accounts.
discussion: "Without the use of multifactor authentication, the ease of access to\
  \ privileged and non-privileged functions is greatly increased.\n\nMultifactor authentication\
  \ requires using two or more factors to achieve authentication.\n\nFactors include:\
  \ \n1) something a user knows (e.g., password/PIN);\n2) something a user has (e.g.,\
  \ cryptographic identification device, token); and\n3) something a user is (e.g.,\
  \ biometric).\n\nA privileged account is defined as an information system account\
  \ with authorizations of a privileged user.\n\nLocal access is defined as access\
  \ to an organizational information system by a user (or process acting on behalf\
  \ of a user) communicating through a direct connection without the use of a network.\n\
  \nThe DoD CAC with DoD-approved PKI is an example of multifactor authentication.\n\
  \n"
check: /usr/sbin/system_profiler SPConfigurationProfileDataType | /usr/bin/grep enforceSmartCard
result: '[''If the results do not show "enforceSmartCard=1", this is a finding.'']'
fix: "This setting is enforced using the \"Smart Card Policy\" configuration profile.\
  \ \n\nNote: Before applying the \"Smart Card Policy\", the supplemental guidance\
  \ provided with the STIG must be consulted to ensure continued access to the operating\
  \ system."
