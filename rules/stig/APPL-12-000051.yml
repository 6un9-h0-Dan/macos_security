title: The macOS system must be configured with the SSH daemon ClientAliveInterval
  option set to 900 or less.
discussion: SSH should be configured to log users out after a 15-minute interval of
  inactivity and to wait only 30 seconds before timing out logon attempts. Terminating
  an idle session within a short time period reduces the window of opportunity for
  unauthorized personnel to take control of a management session enabled on the console
  or console port that has been left unattended. In addition, quickly terminating
  an idle session or an incomplete logon attempt will also free up resources committed
  by the managed network element.
check: /usr/bin/grep ^ClientAliveInterval /etc/ssh/sshd_config
result: '[''If the setting is not "900" or less, this is a finding.'']'
fix: 'To ensure that "ClientAliveInterval" is set correctly, run the following command:


  /usr/bin/sudo /usr/bin/sed -i.bak ''s/.*ClientAliveInterval.*/ClientAliveInterval
  900/'' /etc/ssh/sshd_config'
