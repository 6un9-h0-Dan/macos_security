title: The macOS system must enforce a minimum 15-character password length.
discussion: The minimum password length must be set to 15 characters. Password complexity,
  or strength, is a measure of the effectiveness of a password in resisting attempts
  at guessing and brute-force attacks. Password length is one factor of several that
  helps to determine strength and how long it takes to crack a password. The use of
  more characters in a password helps to exponentially increase the time and/or resources
  required to compromise the password.
check: /usr/sbin/system_profiler SPConfigurationProfileDataType | /usr/bin/grep minLength
result: '[''If the return is null or not "minLength = 15", this is a finding.'']'
fix: This setting is enforced using the "Passcode Policy" configuration profile.
