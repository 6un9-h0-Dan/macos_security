title: The macOS system must be configured so that the sudo command requires smart
  card authentication.
discussion: 'Configuring the operating system to implement organization-wide security
  implementation guides and security checklists ensures compliance with federal standards
  and establishes a common security baseline across DoD that reflects the most restrictive
  security posture consistent with operational requirements.


  Configuration settings are the set of parameters that can be changed in hardware,
  software, or firmware components of the system that affect the security posture
  and/or functionality of the system. Security-related parameters are those parameters
  impacting the security state of the system, including the parameters required to
  satisfy other security control requirements. Security-related parameters include,
  for example: registry settings; account, file, directory permission settings; and
  settings for functions, ports, protocols, services, and remote connections.'
check: cat /etc/pam.d/sudo | grep -i pam_smartcard.so
result: '[''If the text that returns does not include the line, "auth sufficient pam_smartcard.so"
  at the TOP of the listing, this is a finding.'']'
fix: 'Make a backup of the PAM SUDO settings using the following command:


  cp /etc/pam.d/login /etc/pam.d/sudo_backup_`date "+%Y-%m-%d_%H:%M"`


  Replace the contents of "/etc/pam.d/sudo" with the following:


  # sudo: auth account password session

  auth    sufficient   pam_smartcard.so

  #auth    required    pam_opendirectory.so

  auth    required    pam_deny.so

  account  required    pam_permit.so

  password  required    pam_deny.so

  session  required    pam_permit.so'
