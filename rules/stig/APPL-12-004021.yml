title: The macOS system must be configured with the sudoers file configured to authenticate
  users on a per -tty basis.
discussion: "The \"sudo\" command must be configured to prompt for the administrator's\
  \ password at least once in each newly opened Terminal window or remote logon session,\
  \ as this prevents a malicious user from taking advantage of an unlocked computer\
  \ or an abandoned logon session to bypass the normal password prompt requirement.\
  \ \n\nWithout the \"tty_tickets\" option, all open local and remote logon sessions\
  \ would be authenticated to use sudo without a password for the duration of the\
  \ configured password timeout window."
check: /usr/bin/sudo /usr/bin/grep tty_tickets /etc/sudoers
result: '[''If there is no result, this is a finding.'']'
fix: 'Edit the "/etc/sudoers" file to contain the line:


  Defaults tty_tickets


  This line can be placed in the defaults section or at the end of the file.'
