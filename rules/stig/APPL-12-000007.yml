title: The macOS system must be configured to disable hot corners.
discussion: Although hot corners can be used to initiate a session lock or launch
  useful applications, they can also be configured to disable an automatic session
  lock from initiating. Such a configuration introduces the risk that a user might
  forget to manually lock the screen before stepping away from the computer.
check: /usr/sbin/system_profiler SPConfigurationProfileDataType | /usr/bin/grep wvous
result: '[''If the return is null, or does not equal:'', ''"wvous-bl-corner = 0'',
  ''wvous-br-corner = 0;'', ''wvous-tl-corner = 0;'', ''wvous-tr-corner = 0;" '',
  ''this is a finding.'']'
fix: This setting is enforced using the "Custom Policy" configuration profile.
