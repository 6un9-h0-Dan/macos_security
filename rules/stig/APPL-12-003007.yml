title: The macOS system must enforce password complexity by requiring that at least
  one numeric character be used.
discussion: 'Use of a complex password helps to increase the time and resources required
  to compromise the password. Password complexity, or strength, is a measure of the
  effectiveness of a password in resisting attempts at guessing and brute-force attacks.


  Password complexity is one factor of several that determines how long it takes to
  crack a password. The more complex the password, the greater the number of possible
  combinations that need to be tested before the password is compromised.'
check: /usr/sbin/system_profiler SPConfigurationProfileDataType | /usr/bin/grep requireAlphanumeric
result: '[''If the return is not "requireAlphanumeric = 1", this is a finding.'']'
fix: This setting is enforced using the "Passcode Policy" configuration profile.
