rule_id: MSCP RULE
title: The macOS system must enforce the limit of three consecutive invalid logon
  attempts by a user before the user account is locked.
discussion: By limiting the number of failed logon attempts, the risk of unauthorized
  system access via user password guessing, otherwise known as brute forcing, is reduced.
  Limits are imposed by locking the account.
check: Unable to parse the check text
result: Unable to parse the check text
fix: This setting may be enforced using the "Passcode Policy" configuration profile
  or by a directory service.
