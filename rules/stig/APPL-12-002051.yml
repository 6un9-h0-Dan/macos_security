title: The macOS system must be configured to disable the system preference pane for
  TouchID.
discussion: "It is detrimental for operating systems to provide, or install by default,\
  \ functionality exceeding requirements or mission objectives. These unnecessary\
  \ capabilities or services are often overlooked and therefore may remain unsecured.\
  \ They increase the risk to the platform by providing additional attack vectors.\n\
  \nOperating systems are capable of providing a wide variety of functions and services.\
  \ Some of the functions and services, provided by default, may not be necessary\
  \ to support essential organizational operations (e.g., key missions, functions).\
  \ \n\nExamples of non-essential capabilities include but are not limited to games,\
  \ software packages, tools, and demonstration software not related to requirements\
  \ or providing a wide array of functionality not required for every mission but\
  \ that cannot be disabled.\n\nThe TouchID System Preference Pane must be disabled.\n\
  \n"
