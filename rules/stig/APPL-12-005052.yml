title: The macOS system logon window must be configured to prompt for username and
  password, rather than show a list of users.
discussion: The logon window must be configured to prompt all users for both a username
  and a password. By default, the system displays a list of known users at the logon
  screen. This gives an advantage to an attacker with physical access to the system,
  as the attacker would only have to guess the password for one of the listed accounts.
check: /usr/sbin/system_profiler SPConfigurationProfileDataType | /usr/bin/grep SHOWFULLNAME
result: '[''If there is no result, or "SHOWFULLNAME" is not set to "1", this is a
  finding.'']'
fix: This setting is enforced using the "Login Window Policy" configuration profile.
