title: The macOS system must implement cryptographic mechanisms to protect the confidentiality
  and integrity of all information at rest.
discussion: 'Information at rest refers to the state of information when it is located
  on a secondary storage device (e.g., disk drive and tape drive) within an organizational
  information system. Mobile devices, laptops, desktops, and storage devices can be
  lost or stolen, and the contents of their data storage (e.g., hard drives and non-volatile
  memory) can be read, copied, or altered. By encrypting the system hard drive, the
  confidentiality and integrity of any data stored on the system is ensured. FileVault
  Disk Encryption mitigates this risk.


  '
check: /usr/bin/fdesetup status
result: '[''If "FileVault" is "Off" and the device is a mobile device or the organization
  has determined that the drive must encrypt data at rest, this is a finding.'']'
fix: 'Open System Preferences >> Security and Privacy and navigate to the "FileVault"
  tab. Use this panel to configure full-disk encryption.


  Alternately, from the command line, run the following command to enable "FileVault":


  /usr/bin/sudo /usr/bin/fdesetup enable


  After "FileVault" is initially set up, additional users can be added.'
