title: The macOS system must be configured so that log folders must not contain access
  control lists (ACLs).
discussion: The audit service must be configured to create log folders with the correct
  permissions to prevent normal users from reading audit logs. Audit logs contain
  sensitive data about the system and users. If log folders are set to be readable
  and writable only by root or administrative users with sudo, the risk is mitigated.
check: '/usr/bin/sudo ls -lde $(/usr/bin/sudo /usr/bin/grep ''^dir'' /etc/security/audit_control
  | awk -F: ''{print $2}'')'
result: '[''In the output from the above commands, ACLs will be listed under any folder
  that may contain them (e.g., "0: group:admin allow list,readattr,reaadextattr,readsecurity").'',
  '''', ''If any such line exists, this is a finding.'']'
fix: 'For any log folder that contains ACLs, run the following command:


  /usr/bin/sudo chmod -N [audit log folder]'
