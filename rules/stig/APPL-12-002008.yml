title: The macOS system must be configured to disable Web Sharing.
discussion: "To prevent unauthorized connection of devices, unauthorized transfer\
  \ of information, or unauthorized tunneling (i.e., embedding of data types within\
  \ data types), organizations must disable or restrict unused or unnecessary physical\
  \ and logical ports/protocols on information systems.\n\nOperating systems are capable\
  \ of providing a wide variety of functions and services. Some of the functions and\
  \ services provided by default may not be necessary to support essential organizational\
  \ operations. Additionally, it is sometimes convenient to provide multiple services\
  \ from a single component (e.g., VPN and IPS); however, doing so increases risk\
  \ over limiting the services provided by any one component. \n\nTo support the requirements\
  \ and principles of least functionality, the operating system must support the organizational\
  \ requirements, providing only essential capabilities and limiting the use of ports,\
  \ protocols, and/or services to only those required, authorized, and approved to\
  \ conduct official business or to address authorized quality of life issues.\n\n\
  Web Sharing is non-essential and must be disabled."
