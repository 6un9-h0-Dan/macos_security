rule_id: MSCP RULE
title: The macOS system must be configured to disable password forwarding for FileVault2.
discussion: When "FileVault" and Multifactor Authentication are configured on the
  operating system, a dedicated user must be configured to ensure that the implemented
  Multifactor Authentication rules are enforced. If a dedicated user is not configured
  to decrypt the hard disk upon startup, the system will allow a user to bypass Multifactor
  Authentication rules during initial startup and first login.
check: '# /usr/sbin/system_profiler SPConfigurationProfileDataType | /usr/bin/grep
  "DisableFDEAutoLogin"'
result: '[''DisableFDEAutologin = 1;'', '''', ''If "DisableFDEAutologin" is not set
  to a value of "1", this is a finding.'']'
fix: This setting is enforced using the "Smart Card" configuration profile.
