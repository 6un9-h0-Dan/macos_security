title: The macOS system must be configured with audit log folders owned by root.
discussion: The audit service must be configured to create log files with the correct
  ownership to prevent normal users from reading audit logs. Audit logs contain sensitive
  data about the system and about users. If log files are set to be readable and writable
  only by root or administrative users with sudo, the risk is mitigated.
check: '/usr/bin/sudo ls -lde $(/usr/bin/sudo /usr/bin/grep ''^dir'' /etc/security/audit_control
  | awk -F: ''{print $2}'')'
result: '[''The results should show the owner (third column) to be "root". '', '''',
  ''If it does not, this is a finding.'']'
fix: 'For any log folder that has an incorrect owner, run the following command:


  /usr/bin/sudo chown root [audit log folder]'
