title: The macOS system must be configured to disable sending diagnostic and usage
  data to Apple.
discussion: "It is detrimental for operating systems to provide, or install by default,\
  \ functionality exceeding requirements or mission objectives. These unnecessary\
  \ capabilities or services are often overlooked and therefore may remain unsecured.\
  \ They increase the risk to the platform by providing additional attack vectors.\n\
  \nOperating systems are capable of providing a wide variety of functions and services.\
  \ Some of the functions and services, provided by default, may not be necessary\
  \ to support essential organizational operations (e.g., key missions, functions).\
  \ \n\nExamples of non-essential capabilities include but are not limited to games,\
  \ software packages, tools, and demonstration software not related to requirements\
  \ or providing a wide array of functionality not required for every mission but\
  \ that cannot be disabled.\n\nThe ability to submit diagnostic data to Apple must\
  \ be disabled."

fix: 'This setting is enforced using the "Restrictions Policy" configuration profile.


  The setting "Send diagnostic & usage data to Apple" can also be configured in System
  Preferences >> Security & Privacy >> Privacy >> Analytics & Improvement.


  Uncheck the box that says, "Share Mac Analytics".

  Uncheck the box that says, "Improve Siri & Dictation".

  Uncheck the box that says, "Share with App Developers".'
