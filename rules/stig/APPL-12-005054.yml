title: The macOS system must be configured to disable prompts to configure Touch ID.
discussion: 'It is detrimental for operating systems to provide, or install by default,
  functionality exceeding requirements or mission objectives. These unnecessary capabilities
  or services are often overlooked and therefore may remain unsecured. They increase
  the risk to the platform by providing additional attack vectors.


  Operating systems are capable of providing a wide variety of functions and services.
  Some of the functions and services, provided by default, may not be necessary to
  support essential organizational operations (e.g., key missions, functions).


  Examples of non-essential capabilities include, but are not limited to, games, software
  packages, tools, and demonstration software, not related to requirements or providing
  a wide array of functionality not required for every mission, but which cannot be
  disabled.'
check: /usr/sbin/system_profiler SPConfigurationProfileDataType | /usr/bin/grep SkipTouchIDSetup
result: '[''If the return is not "SkipTouchIDSetup = 1", this is a finding.'']'
fix: This setting is enforced using the "Restrictions Policy" configuration profile.
