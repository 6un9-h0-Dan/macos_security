title: The macOS system must accept and verify Personal Identity Verification (PIV)
  credentials, implement a local cache of revocation data to support path discovery
  and validation in case of the inability to access revocation information via the
  network, and only allow the use of DoD PKI-established certificate authorities for
  verification of the establishment of protected sessions.
discussion: "The use of PIV credentials facilitates standardization and reduces the\
  \ risk of unauthorized access.                           \n\nWithout configuring\
  \ a local cache of revocation data, there is the potential to allow access to users\
  \ who are no longer authorized (users with revoked certificates).              \
  \      \n\nUntrusted Certificate Authorities (CA) can issue certificates, but they\
  \ may be issued by organizations or individuals that seek to compromise DoD systems\
  \ or by organizations with insufficient security controls. If the CA used for verifying\
  \ the certificate is not a DoD-approved CA, trust of this CA has not been established.\n\
  \nDoD has mandated the use of the CAC to support identity management and personal\
  \ authentication for systems covered under Homeland Security Presidential Directive\
  \ (HSPD) 12, as well as making the CAC a primary component of layered protection\
  \ for national security systems.       \n\nThe DoD will only accept PKI-certificates\
  \ obtained from a DoD-approved internal or external certificate authority. Reliance\
  \ on CAs for the establishment of secure sessions includes, for example, the use\
  \ of SSL/TLS certificates.\n\n"

fix: "This setting is enforced using the \"Smart Card Policy\" configuration profile.\
  \ \n\nNote: Before applying the \"Smart Card Policy\", the supplemental guidance\
  \ provided with the STIG should be consulted to ensure continued access to the operating\
  \ system."
