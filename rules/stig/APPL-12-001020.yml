title: The macOS system must audit the enforcement actions used to restrict access
  associated with changes to the system.
discussion: "By auditing access restriction enforcement, changes to application and\
  \ OS configuration files can be audited. Without auditing the enforcement of access\
  \ restrictions, it will be difficult to identify attempted attacks and an audit\
  \ trail will not be available for forensic investigation.\n\nEnforcement actions\
  \ are the methods or mechanisms used to prevent unauthorized changes to configuration\
  \ settings. Enforcement action methods may be as simple as denying access to a file\
  \ based on the application of file permissions (access restriction). Audit items\
  \ may consist of lists of actions blocked by access restrictions or changes identified\
  \ after the fact.   \n\nWithout generating audit records that are specific to the\
  \ security and mission needs of the organization, it would be difficult to establish,\
  \ correlate, and investigate the events relating to an incident or identify those\
  \ responsible for one.\n\nAudit records can be generated from various components\
  \ within the information system (e.g., module or policy filter). \n\n"
check: /usr/bin/sudo /usr/bin/grep ^flags /etc/security/audit_control
result: '[''Enforcement actions are logged by way of the "fm" flag, which audits permission
  changes, and "-fr" and "-fw", which denote failed attempts to read or write to a
  file, and -fd, which audits failed file deletion.'', '''', ''If "fm", "-fr", "-fw",
  and "-fd" are not listed in the result of the check, this is a finding.'']'
fix: 'To set the audit flags to the recommended setting, run the following command
  to add the flags "fm", "-fr", "-fw", and "-fd" all at once:


  /usr/bin/sudo /usr/bin/sed -i.bak ''/^flags/ s/$/,fm,-fr,-fw,-fd/'' /etc/security/audit_control;
  /usr/bin/sudo /usr/sbin/audit -s


  A text editor may also be used to implement the required updates to the "/etc/security/audit_control"
  file.'
