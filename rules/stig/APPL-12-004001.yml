rule_id: MSCP RULE
title: The macOS system must be configured with system log files owned by root and
  group-owned by wheel or admin.
discussion: System logs should only be readable by root or admin users. System logs
  frequently contain sensitive information that could be used by an attacker. Setting
  the correct owner mitigates this risk.

result: Unable to parse the check text
fix: "For any log file that returns an incorrect owner or group value, run the following\
  \ command:\n\n/usr/bin/sudo chown root:wheel [log file]\n\n[log file] is the full\
  \ path to the log file in question. If the file is managed by \"newsyslog\", find\
  \ the configuration line in the directory \"/etc/newsyslog.d/\" or the file \"/etc/newsyslog.conf\"\
  \ and ensure that the owner:group column is set to \"root:wheel\" or the appropriate\
  \ service user account and group. \n\nIf the file is managed by \"aslmanager\",\
  \ find the configuration line in the directory \"/etc/asl/\" or the file \"/etc/asl.conf\"\
  \ and ensure that \"uid\" and \"gid\" options are either not present or are set\
  \ to a service user account and group respectively."
