title: The macOS system must set permissions on user home directories to prevent users
  from having access to read or modify another user's files.
discussion: 'Configuring the operating system to use the most restrictive permissions
  possible for user home directories helps to protect against inadvertent disclosures.


  '
check: ls -le /Users
result: '[''Should return a listing of the permissions of the root of every user account
  configured on the system. For each of the users, the permissions should be:'', ''"drwxr-xr-x+"
  with the user listed as the owner and the group listed as "staff". The plus(+) sign
  indicates an associated Access Control List, which should be:'', '' 0: group:everyone
  deny delete'', '''', ''For every authorized user account, also run the following
  command:'', ''/usr/bin/sudo ls -le /Users/userid, where userid is an existing user.
  '', '''', "This command will return the permissions of all of the objects under
  the users'' home directory. The permissions for each of the subdirectories should
  be:", ''drwx------+ '', '' 0: group:everyone deny delete'', '''', ''With the exception
  of the "Public" directory, whose permissions should match the following:'', ''drwxr-xr-x+
  '', '' 0: group:everyone deny delete'', '''', ''If the permissions returned by either
  of these checks differ from what is shown, this is a finding.'']'
fix: 'To ensure the appropriate permissions are set for each user on the system, run
  the following command:


  diskutil resetUserPermissions / userid, where userid is the user name for the user
  whose home directory permissions need to be repaired.'
