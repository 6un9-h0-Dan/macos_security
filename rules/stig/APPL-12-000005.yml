title: The macOS system must be configured to lock the user session when a smart token
  is removed.
discussion: 'A session lock is a temporary action taken when a user stops work and
  moves away from the immediate physical vicinity of the information system but does
  not want to log out because of the temporary nature of the absence.


  The session lock is implemented at the point where session activity can be determined.
  Rather than be forced to wait for a period of time to expire before the user session
  can be locked, operating systems need to provide users with the ability to manually
  invoke a session lock so users may secure their session should they need to temporarily
  vacate the immediate physical vicinity.'
check: /usr/sbin/system_profiler SPConfigurationProfileDataType | /usr/bin/grep "tokenRemovalAction
  = 1;"
result: '[''If there is no result, this is a finding.'']'
fix: "This setting is enforced using the \"Smart Card Policy\" configuration profile.\
  \ \n\nNote: Before applying the \"Smart Card Policy\", the supplemental guidance\
  \ provided with the STIG should be consulted to ensure continued access to the operating\
  \ system."
