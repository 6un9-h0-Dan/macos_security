title: The macOS system must be configured so that the su command requires smart card
  authentication.
discussion: 'Configuring the operating system to implement organization-wide security
  implementation guides and security checklists ensures compliance with federal standards
  and establishes a common security baseline across DoD that reflects the most restrictive
  security posture consistent with operational requirements.


  Configuration settings are the set of parameters that can be changed in hardware,
  software, or firmware components of the system that affect the security posture
  and/or functionality of the system. Security-related parameters are those parameters
  impacting the security state of the system, including the parameters required to
  satisfy other security control requirements. Security-related parameters include,
  for example: registry settings; account, file, directory permission settings; and
  settings for functions, ports, protocols, services, and remote connections.'
check: cat /etc/pam.d/su | grep -i pam_smartcard.so
result: '[''If the text that returns does not include the line, "auth sufficient pam_smartcard.so"
  at the TOP of the listing, this is a finding.'']'
fix: 'Make a backup of the PAM SU settings using the following command:

  cp /etc/pam.d/su /etc/pam.d/su_backup_`date "+%Y-%m-%d_%H:%M"`


  Replace the contents of "/etc/pam.d/su" with the following:


  # su: auth account password session

  auth    sufficient  pam_smartcard.so

  auth    required   pam_rootok.so

  auth    required   pam_group.so no_warn group=admin,wheel ruser root_only fail_safe

  account   required   pam_permit.so

  account   required   pam_opendirectory.so no_check_shell

  password  required   pam_opendirectory.so

  session   required   pam_launchd.so'
