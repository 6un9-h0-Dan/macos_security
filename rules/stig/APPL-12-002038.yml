title: The macOS system must be configured to disable the tftp service.
discussion: "The \"tftp\" service must be disabled as it sends all data in a clear-text\
  \ form that can be easily intercepted and read. The data needs to be protected at\
  \ all times during transmission, and encryption is the standard method for protecting\
  \ data in transit. \n\nIf the data is not encrypted during transmission, it can\
  \ be plainly read (i.e., clear text) and easily compromised. Disabling ftp is one\
  \ way to mitigate this risk. Administrators should be instructed to use an alternate\
  \ service for data transmission that uses encryption, such as SFTP.\n\nAdditionally,\
  \ the \"tftp\" service uses UDP, which is not secure."
check: /bin/launchctl print-disabled system | grep tftpd
result: '[''If the results do not show the following, this is a finding:'', ''"com.apple.tftpd"
  => true'']'
fix: 'To disable the tfpd service, run the following command:


  /usr/bin/sudo /bin/launchctl disable system/com.apple.tftpd'
