title: The macOS system must conceal, via the session lock, information previously
  visible on the display with a publicly viewable image.
discussion: A default screen saver must be configured for all users, as the screen
  saver will act as a session time-out lock for the system and must conceal the contents
  of the screen from unauthorized users. The screen saver must not display any sensitive
  information or reveal the contents of the locked session screen. Publicly viewable
  images can include static or dynamic images such as patterns used with screen savers,
  photographic images, solid colors, a clock, a battery life indicator, or a blank
  screen.
check: /usr/sbin/system_profiler SPConfigurationProfileDataType | /usr/bin/grep loginWindowModulePath
result: '[''If there is no result or defined "modulePath", this is a finding.'']'
fix: This setting is enforced using the "Login Window Policy" configuration profile.
