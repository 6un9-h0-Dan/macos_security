title: The macOS system must restrict the ability of individuals to write to external
  optical media.
discussion: External writeable media devices must be disabled for users. External
  optical media devices can be used to exfiltrate sensitive data if an approved data-loss
  prevention (DLP) solution is not installed.
check: $ /usr/sbin/system_profiler SPConfigurationProfileDataType | /usr/bin/grep
  'BurnSupport'
result: '[''BurnSupport = off;'', '''', ''If the command does not return a line, this
  is a finding.'', "If ''BurnSupport'' is set to a value other than ''off'' and is
  not documented with the Information System Security Officer (ISSO) as an operational
  requirement, this is a finding."]'
fix: This setting is enforced using the "Restrictions Policy" configuration profile.
