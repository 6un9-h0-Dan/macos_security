title: The macOS system must shut down by default upon audit failure (unless availability
  is an overriding concern).
discussion: "The audit service should shut down the computer if it is unable to audit\
  \ system events. Once audit failure occurs, user and system activity is no longer\
  \ recorded and malicious activity could go undetected. Audit processing failures\
  \ include software/hardware errors, failures in the audit capturing mechanisms,\
  \ and audit storage capacity being reached or exceeded. Responses to audit failure\
  \ depend on the nature of the failure mode.\n\nWhen availability is an overriding\
  \ concern, other approved actions in response to an audit failure are as follows:\
  \ \n\n(i) If the failure was caused by the lack of audit record storage capacity,\
  \ the operating system must continue generating audit records if possible (automatically\
  \ restarting the audit service if necessary), overwriting the oldest audit records\
  \ in a first-in-first-out manner. \n\n(ii) If audit records are sent to a centralized\
  \ collection server and communication with this server is lost or the server fails,\
  \ the operating system must queue audit records locally until communication is restored\
  \ or until the audit records are retrieved manually. Upon restoration of the connection\
  \ to the centralized collection server, action should be taken to synchronize the\
  \ local audit data with the collection server."
check: sudo /usr/bin/grep ^policy /etc/security/audit_control | /usr/bin/grep ahlt
result: '[''If there is no result, this is a finding.'']'
fix: 'Edit the "/etc/security/audit_control file" and change the value for policy
  to include the setting "ahlt". To do this programmatically, run the following command:


  sudo /usr/bin/sed -i.bak ''/^policy/ s/$/,ahlt/'' /etc/security/audit_control; sudo
  /usr/sbin/audit -s'
