title: The macOS system must enforce a 60-day maximum password lifetime restriction.
discussion: 'Any password, no matter how complex, can eventually be cracked. Therefore,
  passwords need to be changed periodically.


  One method of minimizing this risk is to use complex passwords and periodically
  change them. If the operating system does not limit the lifetime of passwords and
  force users to change their passwords, there is the risk that the operating system
  passwords could be compromised.'
check: /usr/sbin/system_profiler SPConfigurationProfileDataType | /usr/bin/grep maxPINAgeInDays
result: '[''If "maxPINAgeInDays" is set a value greater than "60", this is a finding.'']'
fix: This setting is enforced using the "Passcode Policy" configuration profile.
