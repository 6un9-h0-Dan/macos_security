title: The macOS system must be configured with audit log folders set to mode 700
  or less permissive.
discussion: 'The audit service must be configured to create log folders with the correct
  permissions to prevent normal users from reading audit logs. Audit logs contain
  sensitive data about the system and users. If log folders are set to be readable
  and writable only by root or administrative users with sudo, the risk is mitigated.


  '
check: '/usr/bin/sudo ls -lde $(/usr/bin/sudo /usr/bin/grep ''^dir'' /etc/security/audit_control
  | awk -F: ''{print $2}'')'
result: '[''The results should show the permissions (first column) to be "700" or
  less permissive.'', '''', ''If they do not, this is a finding.'']'
fix: 'For any log folder that returns an incorrect permission value, run the following
  command:


  /usr/bin/sudo chmod 700 [audit log folder]'
