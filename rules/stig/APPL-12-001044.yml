title: The macOS system must generate audit records for DoD-defined events such as
  successful/unsuccessful logon attempts, successful/unsuccessful direct access attempts,
  starting and ending time for user access, and concurrent logons to the same account
  from different sources.
discussion: 'Without generating audit records that are specific to the security and
  mission needs of the organization, it would be difficult to establish, correlate,
  and investigate the events relating to an incident or identify those responsible
  for one.


  Audit records can be generated from various components within the information system
  (e.g., module or policy filter).


  '
check: /usr/bin/sudo /usr/bin/grep ^flags /etc/security/audit_control
result: '[''Logon events are logged by way of the "aa" flag.'', '''', ''If "aa" is
  not listed in the result of the check, this is a finding.'']'
fix: 'To ensure the appropriate flags are enabled for auditing, run the following
  command:


  /usr/bin/sudo /usr/bin/sed -i.bak ''/^flags/ s/$/,aa/'' /etc/security/audit_control;
  /usr/bin/sudo /usr/sbin/audit -s


  A text editor may also be used to implement the required updates to the "/etc/security/audit_control"
  file.'
