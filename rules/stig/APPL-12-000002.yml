title: The macOS system must retain the session lock until the user reestablishes
  access using established identification and authentication procedures.
discussion: Users must be prompted to enter their passwords when unlocking the screen
  saver. The screen saver acts as a session lock and prevents unauthorized users from
  accessing the current user's account.
check: /usr/sbin/system_profiler SPConfigurationProfileDataType | /usr/bin/grep askForPassword
result: '[''If there is no result, or if "askForPassword" is not set to "1", this
  is a finding.'']'
fix: This setting is enforced using the "Login Window Policy" configuration profile.
