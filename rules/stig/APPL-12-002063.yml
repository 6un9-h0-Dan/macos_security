title: The macOS system must enforce access restrictions.
discussion: 'Failure to provide logical access restrictions associated with changes
  to system configuration may have significant effects on the overall security of
  the system.


  When dealing with access restrictions pertaining to change control, it should be
  noted that any changes to the hardware, software, and/or firmware components of
  the operating system can have significant effects on the overall security of the
  system.


  Accordingly, only qualified and authorized individuals should be allowed to obtain
  access to operating system components for the purposes of initiating changes, including
  upgrades and modifications.


  Logical access restrictions include, for example, controls that restrict access
  to workflow automation, media libraries, abstract layers (e.g., changes implemented
  into third-party interfaces rather than directly into information systems), and
  change windows (e.g., changes occur only during specified times, making unauthorized
  changes easy to discover).'
check: '# /usr/sbin/system_profiler SPConfigurationProfileDataType | /usr/bin/grep
  DisableGuestAccount'
result: '[''If the result is null or not "DisableGuestAccount = 1", this is a finding.'']'
fix: This setting is enforced using the "Login Window Policy" configuration profile.
