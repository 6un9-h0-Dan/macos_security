title: The macOS system must disable the Screen Sharing feature.
discussion: The Screen Sharing feature allows remote users to view or control the
  desktop of the current user. A malicious user can take advantage of screen sharing
  to gain full access to the system remotely, either with stolen credentials or by
  guessing the username and password. Disabling Screen Sharing mitigates this risk.
check: /usr/bin/sudo /bin/launchctl print-disabled system | /usr/bin/grep com.apple.screensharing
result: '[''If the results do not show the following, this is a finding:'', '''',
  ''"com.apple.screensharing" => true'']'
fix: 'To disable the Screen Sharing service, run the following command:


  /usr/bin/sudo /bin/launchctl disable system/com.apple.screensharing


  The system may need to be restarted for the update to take effect.'
