title: The macOS system must be configured with audit log files owned by root.
discussion: The audit service must be configured to create log files with the correct
  ownership to prevent normal users from reading audit logs. Audit logs contain sensitive
  data about the system and users. If log files are set to only be readable and writable
  by root or administrative users with sudo, the risk is mitigated.
check: '/usr/bin/sudo ls -le $(/usr/bin/sudo /usr/bin/grep ''^dir'' /etc/security/audit_control
  | awk -F: ''{print $2}'') | grep -v current'
result: '[''The results should show the owner (third column) to be "root". '', '''',
  ''If they do not, this is a finding.'']'
fix: 'For any log file that returns an incorrect owner, run the following command:


  /usr/bin/sudo chown root [audit log file]


  [audit log file] is the full path to the log file in question.'
