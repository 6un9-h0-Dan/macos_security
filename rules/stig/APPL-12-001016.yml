title: The macOS system must be configured with audit log files set to mode 440 or
  less permissive.
discussion: The audit service must be configured to create log files with the correct
  permissions to prevent normal users from reading audit logs. Audit logs contain
  sensitive data about the system and about users. If log files are set to be readable
  and writable only by root or administrative users with sudo, the risk is mitigated.
check: '/usr/bin/sudo ls -le $(/usr/bin/sudo /usr/bin/grep ''^dir'' /etc/security/audit_control
  | awk -F: ''{print $2}'') | /usr/bin/grep -v current'
result: '[''The results should show the permissions (first column) to be "440" or
  less permissive.'', '''', ''If they do not, this is a finding.'']'
fix: 'For any log file that returns an incorrect permission value, run the following
  command:


  /usr/bin/sudo chmod 440 [audit log file]


  [audit log file] is the full path to the log file in question.'
