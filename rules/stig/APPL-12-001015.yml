title: The macOS system must be configured with audit log folders group-owned by wheel.
discussion: The audit service must be configured to create log files with the correct
  group ownership to prevent normal users from reading audit logs. Audit logs contain
  sensitive data about the system and about users. If log files are set to be readable
  and writable only by root or administrative users with sudo, the risk is mitigated.
check: '/usr/bin/sudo ls -lde $(/usr/bin/sudo /usr/bin/grep ''^dir'' /etc/security/audit_control
  | awk -F: ''{print $2}'')'
result: '[''The results should show the group (fourth column) to be "wheel".'', '''',
  ''If they do not, this is a finding.'']'
fix: 'For any log folder that has an incorrect group, run the following command:


  /usr/bin/sudo chgrp wheel [audit log folder]'
