rule_id: MSCP RULE
title: The macOS system must initiate the session lock no more than five seconds after
  a screen saver is started.
discussion: A screen saver must be enabled and set to require a password to unlock.
  An excessive grace period impacts the ability for a session to be truly locked,
  requiring authentication to unlock.
check: /usr/sbin/system_profiler SPConfigurationProfileDataType | /usr/bin/grep askForPasswordDelay
result: '[''If there is no result, or if "askForPasswordDelay" is not set to "5.0"
  or less, this is a finding.'']'
fix: This setting is enforced using the "Login Window Policy" configuration profile.
