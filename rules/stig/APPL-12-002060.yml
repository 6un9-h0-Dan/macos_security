title: The macOS system must allow only applications that have a valid digital signature
  to run.
discussion: Gatekeeper settings must be configured correctly to only allow the system
  to run applications signed with a valid Apple Developer ID code. Administrator users
  will still have the option to override these settings on a per-app basis. Gatekeeper
  is a security feature that ensures that applications must be digitally signed by
  an Apple-issued certificate in order to run. Digital signatures allow the macOS
  host to verify that the application has not been modified by a malicious third party.
check: ''
result: '['''', ''Verify only applications with a valid digital signature are allowed
  to run:'', '''', "/usr/sbin/system_profiler SPConfigurationProfileDataType | /usr/bin/grep
  -E ''(EnableAssessment | AllowIdentifiedDevelopers)''", '''', ''If the return is
  null or is not the following, this is a finding:'', '''', ''AllowIdentifiedDevelopers
  = 1;'', ''EnableAssessment = 1;'']'
fix: This setting is enforced using the "Restrictions Policy" configuration profile.
