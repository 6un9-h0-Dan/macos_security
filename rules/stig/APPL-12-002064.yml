discussion: 'Any changes to the hardware, software, and/or firmware components of
  the information system and/or application can potentially have significant effects
  on the overall security of the system.


  Accordingly, software defined by the organization as critical must be signed with
  a certificate that is recognized and approved by the organization.'
