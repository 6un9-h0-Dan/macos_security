rule_id: MSCP RULE
title: The macOS system must prohibit password reuse for a minimum of five generations.
discussion: Password complexity, or strength, is a measure of the effectiveness of
  a password in resisting attempts at guessing and brute-force attacks. If the information
  system or application allows the user to consecutively reuse their password when
  that password has exceeded its defined lifetime, the end result is a password that
  is not changed as per policy requirements.
check: /usr/sbin/system_profiler SPConfigurationProfileDataType | /usr/bin/grep pinHistory
result: '[''If the return is not "pinHistory = 5" or greater, this is a finding.'']'
fix: This setting is enforced using the "Passcode Policy" configuration profile.
