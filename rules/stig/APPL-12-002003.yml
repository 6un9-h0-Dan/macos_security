title: The macOS system must be configured to disable the Network File System (NFS)
  daemon unless it is required.
discussion: If the system does not require access to NFS file shares or is not acting
  as an NFS server, support for NFS is non-essential and NFS services must be disabled.
  NFS is a network file system protocol supported by UNIX-like operating systems.
  Enabling any service increases the attack surface for an intruder. By disabling
  unnecessary services, the attack surface is minimized.
check: ''
result: '['''', ''"com.apple.nfsd" => true'']'
fix: 'To disable the NFS daemon, run the following command:


  /usr/bin/sudo /bin/launchctl disable system/com.apple.nfsd


  The system may need to be restarted for the update to take effect.'
