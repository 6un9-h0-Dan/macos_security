title: The macOS system must be configured with Bluetooth turned off unless approved
  by the organization.
discussion: 'Without protection of communications with wireless peripherals, confidentiality
  and integrity may be compromised because unprotected communications can be intercepted
  and either read, altered, or used to compromise the operating system.


  This requirement applies to wireless peripheral technologies (e.g., wireless mice,
  keyboards, displays, etc.) used with an operating system. Wireless peripherals (e.g.,
  Wi-Fi/Bluetooth/IR keyboards, mice, and pointing devices and Near Field Communications
  [NFC]) present a unique challenge by creating an open, unsecured port on a computer.
  Wireless peripherals must meet DoD requirements for wireless data transmission and
  be approved for use by the AO. Even though some wireless peripherals, such as mice
  and pointing devices, do not ordinarily carry information that need to be protected,
  modification of communications with these wireless peripherals may be used to compromise
  the operating system. Communication paths outside the physical protection of a controlled
  boundary are exposed to the possibility of interception and modification.


  Protecting the confidentiality and integrity of communications with wireless peripherals
  can be accomplished by physical means (e.g., employing physical barriers to wireless
  radio frequencies) or by logical means (e.g., employing cryptographic techniques).
  If physical means of protection are employed, then logical means (cryptography)
  do not have to be employed, and vice versa. If the wireless peripheral is only passing
  telemetry data, encryption of the data may not be required.

fix: This setting is enforced using the "Custom Policy" and "Restrictions Policy"
  configuration profiles.
