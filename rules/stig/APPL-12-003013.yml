title: The macOS system must be configured with a firmware password to prevent access
  to single user mode and booting from alternative media.
discussion: Single user mode and the boot picker, as well as numerous other tools
  are available on macOS through booting while holding the "Option" key down. Setting
  a firmware password restricts access to these tools.
check: $ sudo /usr/sbin/firmwarepasswd -check
result: '[''If the return is not "Password Enabled: Yes", this is a finding.'']'
fix: 'To set a firmware passcode use the following command.


  sudo /usr/sbin/firmwarepasswd -setpasswd


  Note: If firmware password or passcode is forgotten, the only way to reset the forgotten
  password is through the use of a machine specific binary generated and provided
  by Apple. Schedule a support call, and provide proof of purchase before the firmware
  binary will be generated.'
