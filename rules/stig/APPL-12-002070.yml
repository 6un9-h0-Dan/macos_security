title: The macOS system must use an approved antivirus program.
discussion: 'An approved antivirus product must be installed and configured to run.


  Malicious software can establish a base on individual desktops and servers. Employing
  an automated mechanism to detect this type of software will aid in elimination of
  the software from the operating system.'
check: /bin/launchctl print-disabled system | grep mrt
result: '[''If the results show "com.apple.mrt" => false", the MRT Service is running.'',
  '''', ''If the MRT service is running, verify that it is configured to update automatically
  by using the following command:'', '''', ''/usr/sbin/system_profiler SPConfigurationProfileDataType
  | /usr/bin/grep ConfigDataInstall'', '''', ''If, "ConfigDataInstall = 1" is not
  returned, this is a finding.'', '''', ''If the MRT service is not running, ask the
  System Administrator (SA) or Information System Security Officer (ISSO) if an approved
  antivirus solution is loaded on the system. The antivirus solution may be bundled
  with an approved host-based security solution.'', '''', ''If there is no local antivirus
  solution installed on the system, this is a finding.'']'
fix: 'Enable the MRT service:


  /usr/bin/sudo /bin/launchctl enable system/com.apple.mrt


  Installing the "Restrictions Policy" will configure the MRT Service to update automatically.


  If the MRT Service is not being used, install an approved antivirus solution onto
  the system.'
