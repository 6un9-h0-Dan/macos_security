title: The macOS system must cover or disable the built-in or attached camera when
  not in use.
discussion: 'It is detrimental for operating systems to provide, or install by default,
  functionality exceeding requirements or mission objectives. These unnecessary capabilities
  or services are often overlooked and therefore may remain unsecured. They increase
  the risk to the platform by providing additional attack vectors.


  Failing to disconnect from collaborative computing devices (i.e., cameras) can result
  in subsequent compromises of organizational information. Providing easy methods
  to physically disconnect from such devices after a collaborative computing session
  helps to ensure that participants actually carry out the disconnect activity without
  having to go through complex and tedious procedures.


  '
check: /usr/sbin/system_profiler SPConfigurationProfileDataType | /usr/bin/grep allowCamera
result: '[''If the result is "allowCamera = 1" and the collaborative computing device
  has not been authorized for use, this is a finding.'']'
fix: This setting is enforced using the "Restrictions Policy" configuration profile.
