title: The macOS system must enforce password complexity by requiring that at least
  one special character be used.
discussion: 'Use of a complex password helps to increase the time and resources required
  to compromise the password. Password complexity or strength is a measure of the
  effectiveness of a password in resisting attempts at guessing and brute-force attacks.
  Password complexity is one factor in determining how long it takes to crack a password.
  The more complex the password, the greater the number of possible combinations that
  need to be tested before the password is compromised. Special characters are those
  characters that are not alphanumeric. Examples include: ~ ! @ # $ % ^ *.'
check: /usr/sbin/system_profiler SPConfigurationProfileDataType | /usr/bin/grep minComplexChars
result: '[''If the return is null or not "minComplexChars = 1", this is a finding.'',
  '''', ''Run the following command to check if the system is configured to require
  that passwords not contain repeated sequential characters or characters in increasing
  and decreasing sequential order:'', '''', ''/usr/sbin/system_profiler SPConfigurationProfileDataType
  | /usr/bin/grep allowSimple'', '''', ''If "allowSimple" is not set to "0" or is
  undefined, this is a finding.'']'
fix: This setting may be enforced using the "Passcode Policy" configuration profile
  or by a directory service.
