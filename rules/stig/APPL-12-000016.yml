title: The macOS system must be integrated into a directory services infrastructure.
discussion: Distinct user account databases on each separate system cause problems
  with username and password policy enforcement. Most approved directory services
  infrastructure solutions allow centralized management of users and passwords.
check: /usr/bin/dscl localhost -list . | /usr/bin/grep "Active Directory"
result: '[''If no results are returned, this is a finding.'']'
fix: Integrate the system into an existing directory services infrastructure.
