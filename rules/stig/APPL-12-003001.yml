title: The macOS system must issue or obtain public key certificates under an appropriate
  certificate policy from an approved service provider.
discussion: 'DoD-approved certificates must be installed to the System Keychain so
  they will be available to all users.


  For user certificates, each organization obtains certificates from an approved,
  shared service provider, as required by OMB policy. For federal agencies operating
  a legacy public key infrastructure cross-certified with the Federal Bridge Certification
  Authority at medium assurance or higher, this Certification Authority will suffice.
  This control focuses on certificates with a visibility external to the information
  system and does not include certificates related to internal system operations;
  for example, application-specific time services. Use of weak or untested encryption
  algorithms undermines the purposes of utilizing encryption to protect data. The
  operating system must implement cryptographic modules adhering to the higher standards
  approved by the federal government since this provides assurance they have been
  tested and validated.

check: /usr/bin/sudo /usr/bin/security dump-keychain | /usr/bin/grep labl | awk -F\"
  '{ print $4 }'
result: '[''If this list contains unapproved certificates, this is a finding.'']'
fix: Obtain the approved DOD certificates from the appropriate authority. Use Keychain
  Access from "/Applications/Utilities" to add certificates to the System Keychain.
